    ## Footlocker Monitor Updates (by Christopher Betancourt) 

### New Features:

We have made significant updates to the **Footlocker** monitor, with contributions by Christopher Betancourt. These changes enhance the functionality and adaptability of the monitor:

1. **SMS Notifications**:
    - The Footlocker monitor now has the capability to send SMS notifications for restocks or product releases, as an alternative to using Discord Webhook.
    - Integration with the **Textlocal** API allows SMS alerts to be sent directly to a configured phone number.
    - Configuration of SMS notifications can be managed in the `config.py` file, where you can provide your **Textlocal API Key**, sender name, and target phone number.

2. **CAPTCHA Solving**:
    - Footlocker frequently employs CAPTCHA challenges to block automated access.
    - We've integrated **2Captcha** to solve these CAPTCHA challenges automatically, ensuring the monitor can continue functioning without manual intervention.
    - To enable CAPTCHA solving, provide your **2Captcha API Key** (`TWOCAPTCHA_API_KEY`) in the `config.py` file.

### Configuration Overview:

To use the updated Footlocker monitor:

1. **Configure `config.py`**:
    - Set your region (`LOCATION`) to `US`, `UK`, or `AU`.
    - Enable free proxies or provide your own proxy list for anonymity.
    - Set up **Textlocal** SMS settings (`TEXTLOCAL_API_KEY`, `SENDER`, `TARGET_PHONE_NUMBER`).
    - Provide your **2Captcha API Key** (`TWOCAPTCHA_API_KEY`) for CAPTCHA-solving functionality.

### Running the Monitor:

After configuring `config.py`, you can start the Footlocker monitor by running the `monitor.py` script:

```sh
python monitor.py

## About the Project
This project is aimed at providing web-monitors for various sites to the sneaker community for free. 
A monitor is a tool that tracks and alerts about changes on website.
These monitors currently notify if a restock or release occurs via Discord Webhook or SMS on popular sneaker related websites.

Today, competition to purchase sneakers is getting increasingly difficult with resellers using paid automated tools to give them a massive advantage over everyone else.
As such, I have and will continue to develop monitors that will help those members that struggle to finally get the sneakers they want.

This project is continually expanding, and I would greatly appreciate any contributions. 
When contributing please fork the project and open a Pull Request.

However, due to popular demand, I am developing a paid (but competitively priced) set of hosted monitors. These will be released on my Discord Server that you can join in [#Contact](#Contact).
